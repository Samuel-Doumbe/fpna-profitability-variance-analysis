# FP&A Profitability & Variance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end FP&A analytics platform built using:

- SQL Server
- SQL
- Python
- Power BI
- GitHub

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how modern finance teams can leverage analytics engineering, automation, AI-enhanced analytics workflows, and business intelligence to improve:

- profitability analysis
- budget monitoring
- forecast performance tracking
- executive decision-making

This project was built as part of my transition into Tech Finance and modern data-driven financial analytics.

# Business Problem

Finance teams require scalable analytical solutions to:

- monitor profitability performance
- analyze revenue trends
- compare actuals vs budget
- track forecast accuracy
- identify margin drivers
- support executive decision-making

Traditional spreadsheet-based reporting often creates:

- manual processes
- inconsistent calculations
- limited scalability
- reduced analytical visibility

This project demonstrates how SQL, Python, and Power BI can be integrated into a modern FP&A analytics workflow.
